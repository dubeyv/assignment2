		<h3> Welcome to SWE645 - Component Based Software Development </h3>
		<p> This page is deployed on an nginx webserver, and everything is containerized. </p>
		<p> A Docker container is a standardized, encapsulated environment that runs applications. 
		It's a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything the application needs to run, such as code, libraries, runtime, and system tools. Think of it as a "shipping container" for software, allowing applications to be deployed consistently across different environments. </p>
